                <p>A JavaScript accordion is a useful way to squeeze lots of page content into a small space. It consists of a list of items, of which only one is expanded at any one time. When you click on another item's heading, the first item collapses and the second item expands</p>

                <p>JavaScript is a client-side as well as server side scripting language that can be inserted into HTML pages and is understood by web browsers. JavaScript is also an Object based Programming language

                <p>JavaScript is faster. JavaScript is a client-side language and thus it does not need the assistance of the web server to execute. On the other hand, ASP is a server-side language and hence is always slower than JavaScript. Javascript now is also a server side language (nodejs).
